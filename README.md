# Gym Buddy Frontend
Gym Buddy Frontend is a TypeScript and React-based web application designed to serve as the user interface for managing gym operations. 
It provides a seamless experience for gym members and staff, allowing them to interact with the Gym Buddy system efficiently.

## Project Status

Gym Buddy is a work in progress. While the core features such as user authentication and basic dashboard functionality are implemented, there is ongoing development to enhance the application with additional features and improve the user experience.
The project has recently undergone a significant refactor, with the codebase being rewritten in TypeScript. This transition aims to leverage TypeScript's static typing and advanced tooling features to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.

## Deployment Demo

A demo version of the Gym Buddy Frontend is available for preview. You can access the deployed demo [here](#https://jade-beijinho-9f67b9.netlify.app/).
